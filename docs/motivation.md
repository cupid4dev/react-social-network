# Motivation

As my target in this project, I've intended to build a social network with features of new and powerful web technologies such as [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) as a front-end tool in [React Social Network](https://github.com/Qolzam/react-social-network) project and build a powerful backend by [ASP.NET Core 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/)  with its cool new features in [ASP.NET Core Social Network](https://github.com/Qolzam/aspnet-core-social-network). I also use [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) to build a powerful mobile social app in [React Mobile Social](https://github.com/Qolzam/react-mobile-social). All cool new features are providing as an open source project under MIT LICENSE and it's so great ;).
